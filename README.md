# hello-world
This is my training repository.
I started writing Basic scripts almost 30 years ago (didn't we all?) yet only started developing professionally about a decade ago. My weapons of choice are PHP, MySQL, HTML5 and of course CSS3. I'm dangerous more than anything in JS, more comfortable so far with server-side, but use client-side beacause, well you know, it has a big place in the scheme of things. Gotta adapt!
My predilection is toward custom development, do not care for WP and other templates. Note to self: Gotta adapt!
